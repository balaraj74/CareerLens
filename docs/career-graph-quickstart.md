## 📊 How Scores Are Calculated

### Skill Proficiency Weight (0-100)
```
Weight = Frequency + Recency + Intensity

Frequency Score (0-40):
  → More practice = higher score
  → Each activity adds points

Recency Score (0-30):
  → Recent practice = higher score
  → Loses points over time

Intensity Score (0-30):
  → Based on activity impact
  → Interviews & courses > profile updates
```

### Career Readiness Score (0-100)
```
Readiness = Average Skill Weight + Bonuses

Diversity Bonus (0-20):
  → Having skills in multiple categories

Recency Bonus (0-15):
  → Practicing within last 30 days
```

### Activity Impact Levels
| Activity Type       | Impact | Weight |
|---------------------|--------|--------|
| Course Completed    | 9      | High   |
| Interview Done      | 8      | High   |
| Project Added       | 8      | High   |
| Experience Added    | 7      | Medium |
